# WebLinkCollector project common rules

## Test-related
- Test coverage should be maintained above 91%.
- Appropriate mocking and timer handling for testing asynchronous processes
- Ensure that ESLint checks are passed before running tests

## Coding style
- Prefix unused arguments and variables with `_` (e.g. `_message`, `_args`)
- Do not leave console output (console.log, console.error, etc.) in production code
- Use logger interfaces to log output at the appropriate log level.

## URL processing
- Appropriate exclusion of URLs contained within query parameters and hash fragments
- Handle social media share links (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) with special care.
- Explicit URL condition filtering using the `FilterConditions` type.
- Always exclude administrative paths defined in DEFAULT_EXCLUDED_PATHS.

## Error handling
- Use try-catch syntax and catch and log errors appropriately.
- Exceptions such as URL parsing failures should be handled explicitly and a default safe behaviour defined.

## Performance considerations
- When processing large numbers of URLs, set appropriate delays and take rate limits into account.
- Be aware of memory usage and process large HTML strings efficiently.

## Code quality
- Ensure Husky pre-commit hooks are passed before pull requests
- When adding new functionality, be sure to add corresponding test cases
- Make sure all existing tests pass after refactoring
